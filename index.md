## About Me

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, working under the supervision of Professor [**Yu Cheng**](https://ych133.github.io/). My current research focuses on advancing multimodal large language models (LLMs), exploring how these models can integrate and process diverse forms of data to drive innovation in AI.

Prior to my Ph.D., I earned my Master's degree from the University of Waterloo, where I conducted research under the guidance of Professor [**Wenhu Chen**](https://wenhuchen.github.io/). My academic journey began at HKUST, where I completed my Bachelor's degree in Data Science. During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at several leading tech organizations, including Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA), Alibaba DAMO Academy, Google, and Tencent. These experiences have equipped me with a broad perspective on the application of AI technologies across various industries.

Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy spending my spare time fishing and cooking, finding creativity and relaxation in both activities.

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** large language model reasoning and evaluation
- **Multimodal LLM:** MoE with Multimodal LLM
